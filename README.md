# Pomodoro Timer ‚è≥

## Overview 
The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool that helps users focus on tasks using the Pomodoro Technique. This method consists of 25-minute work sessions followed by short breaks, with a longer break after every four cycles.

This timer follows the cycle:
```bash
25 mins - Work  
5 mins - Break  
25 mins - Work  
5 mins - Break  
25 mins - Work  
5 mins - Break  
25 mins - Work  
20 mins - Long Break  
```
## Features 
- ‚úÖ Automatic Cycle Progression ‚Äì No need to manually start the next session.
- ‚úÖ Visual Timer Display ‚Äì Shows countdown for each session.
- ‚úÖ Sound Notifications ‚Äì Alerts when work or break time ends.
- ‚úÖ Customizable Durations ‚Äì Modify work/break durations if needed.
- ‚úÖ Minimalist UI ‚Äì Simple and distraction-free interface.

## Installation and Setup 
- ### Clone the Repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pomodoro-timer.git
cd pomodoro-timer
```
- ### Install Dependencies
If using Python, install required packages (for GUI or sound alerts):
```bash
pip install tkinter pygame
```
If using JavaScript (React/Vanilla JS), ensure dependencies (React Timer Hooks, etc.) are installed.
- ### Run the Application
For Python:
```bash
python pomodoro.py
```
For Web (React/Vanilla JS):
```bash
npm start
```

## Usage Instructions 
1. Start the Timer ‚Äì Click the Start button to begin the first 25-minute work session.
2. Automatic Breaks ‚Äì After each session, the timer automatically switches to the break period.
3. Session Tracking ‚Äì After four work sessions, a 20-minute long break is triggered.
4. Pause/Reset ‚Äì Pause or reset the timer at any point.

## How it works (Logic)
- The timer runs a cycle of 4 work sessions (25 mins each).
- After each work session, a 5-minute break is taken.
- After completing 4 work sessions, a 20-minute long break follows.
- The cycle then repeats.
